# VividSense

Welcome to the **VividSense** repository! This repository contains code for the **VivdSense** organization website, as well as code from prior generations of VividSense products (e.g. The Surrounding Scanner).

## Project Overview
The Surrounding Scanner is a cost-effective solution for enhancing mobility and independence of the visually impaired. Using ultrasonic technology, the glasses detect nearby obstacles or objects and alert the wearer via audio feedback, helping them navigate their environment safely and confidently.

## Why VividSense?
- **Affordability:** At ~$35 starting price per unit with a 48% profit margin, VividSense is an accessible solution for those in need.
- **Innovation:** 85% of profits are reinvested into research and development to improve hardware and usability.
- **Scalability:** Our goal is to sell 10,000 units over the next five years, collaborating with retailers and investors for future growth.

## Website Features
- **Product Showcase:** Detailed information about The Surrounding Scanner and its components.
- **Accessibility-Focused Design:** Ensuring usability for visually impaired users.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, and mobile devices.
- **Technical Specifications:** Information about the sensor, speaker, motherboard, breadboard, frame, and battery.

## Future Endeavors
- **Stronger Technology** TSS v2.0 will use a Raspberry Pi 5 to allow for object detection and more accurate distance tracking.
- **AI Implementation** The Raspberry Pi will be used for AI processing to determine the type of object in front of the user.
- **Minimizing Size** The new module will be significantly smaller and more portable to enhance convenience.
